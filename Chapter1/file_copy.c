/*
What appears to be a character on the keyboard or screen is of course, like
everything else, stored internally just as a bit pattern. The type char is
specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be
used. We used int for a subtle but important reason.

The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution is
that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value
that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called EOF, for
``end of file''. We must declare c to be a type big enough to hold any value
that getchar returns. We can't use char since c must be big enough to hold EOF
in addition to any possible char. Therefore we use int.

EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>, but the specific numeric value doesn't
matter as long as it is not the same as any char value. By using the symbolic
constant, we are assured that nothing in the program depends on the specific
numeric value.
